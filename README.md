<p>
This project is designed to help businesses efficiently manage their inventory. Users can easily add, view, update, and delete products in the database, providing comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality.
Additionally, users can track their profits over specific time periods, allowing for better financial analysis and decision-making.
For administrative control, there's an admin panel that empowers administrators to oversee all user activities on the website and maintain control over user management.
